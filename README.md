BatWorm is on the boarder of malware and software. It is malware, but (according to windows defender) it's software at the same time. 

# How to install
Download the latest BatWorm.zip from releases.
Extract the zip file and run Install.bat.
Restart yur computer and if you get an error, it works!

# How it works
BatWorm uses a barch file and places another batch file in your system. When you log into your computer, it gets ran and downloads itself from the latest release. Pretty cool, huh!
